SUMMARY OF GIT BASIC COMMANDS

create a directory for your local repository
	mkdir ~/myproj

create a local git repository
	init git

create your source file
	touch myfile.txt

check status of repository
	git status -> would show myfile.txt as an untracked file

add the file to the git staging environment (also referred to as index)
	git add

repeat status check
	git status -> now shows myfile.txt under "Changes to be committed:, new file:"

check-in staged files into the git central repository
	git commit -m "my first source file for the project"

create a new branch off the master branch/working branch
	git checkout -b <my branch name>  

check status of your branch
	git branch  -> should show the new branch name under prior master/working branch

	notes:  you can switch back and forth between master and new branch.  If you check-in
		files on the master branch, they are not seen on the new branch until merged.

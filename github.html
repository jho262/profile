<h1>GitHub</h1>
<p>GitHub is a free online version control tool.  All you need to do is to create an account and you can use the repository to maintain your source files.  To allow checkin from the terminal window, you can generate ssh keys and load your public key to your GitHub account.

The development and maintenance of my online profile page is accomplished using GitHub in combination with Jenkins.<br/><br/>
The source code and Jenkins related scripts are saved at <a href='https://github.com/jho262/profile'>my GitHub account</a>.
Using my locally installed Jenkins, a web-hook was created that would automate the deployment and validation of the HTML files for my online profile page whenever my GitHub account was updated.<br/><br/>

Some commonly used GitHub commands can be found at: <a href='Git_Basic_Commands.txt''>Useful GitHub Commands</a> page.

Also, for a good tutorial on Git, see the Edureka <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQcFE0RD0cQ'>DevOps Tutorial</a> for Beginners.  The GitHub tutorial starts at approximately 1 hour into the video.

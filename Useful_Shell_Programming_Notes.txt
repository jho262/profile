Below are some useful notes for shell programming and debugging.  Although the information can 
be found on the web, it is compiled here for quick reference.


Strange output from "echo" command
==================================

Within a shell script, a large number of variables were being printed with the echo command.
Some of the variables contained text that were extracted from logs (apparently, this text
contained the LF character).  In reviewing the output produced by the echo command, it was 
found that some of the latter variables were overwriting the text of the earlier variables.

The problem was found to be the existence of the LF character $'\r' in some of the variables.
Refer to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21909015/strange-echo-output for a detailed 
explanation of this issue.

To see the LF character contained in the linux variable, do the following:
  printf '%q\n' "$variable"

To remove the $'\r' LF character, do the following:
  variable=${variable//$'\r'}


Sample expect script
====================
Expect scripts are used as a substitute for ssh keys.  They allow you to connect to a remote
server and execute commands without being prompted interactively for a login and password.

The below bash script invokes expect to connect to a remote server in order to collect status 
information and writes to a local file.

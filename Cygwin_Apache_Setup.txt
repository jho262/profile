Setting up Apache 2.4 and PHP under Cygwin (updated) (Quick & easy Cygwin Apache/PHP setup guide)
Note: This information is updated to include a recent change to Apache 2.4 for Cygwin. The old command to configure the Apache web server /usr/sbin/httpd2-config is now obsolete. The new command is /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd install

Also note that the old Cygwin package apache2-mod_php5 is now called httpd-mod_php5

See below for full instructions.

1. Install Cygwin or Cygwin64

2. During install, select the following packages to install:

httpd libapr1-devel libaprutil1-devel httpd-mod_php5

If you want other optional PHP components, select those also. Here are a few popular examples:

php-fileinfo php-mysqli php-gd php-Archive_Tar php-bz2 php-zlib

3. After the install is finished, open a Cygwin terminal as Administrator and run:

cygserver-config (answer “yes” to prompt)

/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd install

4. Start cygserver and httpd:

From within the same Cygwin terminal running as Administrator, run:

cygrunsrv -S cygserver

cygrunsrv -S httpd
	--> Added steps:  modify /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file
		(a) Enable "LoadModule slotmem_shtm_module modules/mod_slote_shm.so"
		(b) Enable "LoadModule heartmonitor_module modules/mod_heartmonitor.so"

5. Everything should be working. If there was an error at startup look at /var/log/httpd/error_log

6. Reload Apache with the new configuration:

from the Administrator terminal run:

/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd reload
	--> If you get an error such as "Reloading httpd daemon configuration: unsupported. /etc/rc.d/httpd restart".  Try /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd start

8. The document root is at:

/srv/www/htdocs/

9. Open a browser and enter localhost/indexhtml.  You should see "It Works!" displayed in the browser.

<h1>Web Development</h1>
<p>
Developing web pages is another one of my passions.  Data extracted from sources such as OS files, version control systems, and databases are typically complex and extensive.  A very effective way to communicate data to management is to summarize the information on a web page with drill down capability to expand into the details if needed.
</p>
<p>
In my various roles in the IT field, I have created numerous custom web-based dashboards that were automatically updated with scheduled jobs.  This had the advantage of viewing up-to-date information in an easy to read tabular format and reducing effort in producing manual reports.
</p>
<p>
Besides the many automated dashboards that have been created for monitoring applications and server hardware parameters, the below web development projects have also been completed:
<ul>
<li><span>My <a href='/profile'>online profile page</a> is built with jQuery, CSS, PHP, MySQL, HTML, and AJAX.</span></li>
<li><span><a href="/home_improvement/wood_fence_repair/wood_fence_repair.php">Wood Fence Repair Project</a> is built with PHP, jQuery, CSS, and HTML.</span></li>
<li><span><a href="/afs10/afs.php">Insurance Agent's Web Site</a> utilized AJAX, jQuery, PHP, CSS, Javascript, Photoshop generated graphics, and centralized quote form configuration file for maintainability and scalability.</span></li> 
</ul>

<fieldset>
<p>Refer to <a href='http://macosxbits.com/2015/03/download-install-mysql-server-in-mac-os-x/' target='_blank'>http://macosxbits.com/2015/03/download-install-mysql-server-in-mac-os-x/</a> for instructions on how to download and install MySQL.  The steps are re-iterated below with some minor changes and additions.<br />

<ul type='disc'>
  <li>Download the MySQL Mac OS X DMG archive from: <a href='http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/' target='_blank'>http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/</a> </li>
  <li>Open downloaded file mysql*.dmg, and then open mysql*.pkg file to start installation process.</li>
  <li>Now follow the steps in installation window and enter your macâ€™s password when prompted.</li>
  <li>When the installation is completed, you will see something indicating &quot;The installation was completed successfully&quot;</li>
  <li>Edit your $PATH variable to include the path to the mysql executable.  The best way to do this is to create your source file and add the following entry:  &quot;export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin&quot;</li>
  <li>In the terminal command line, enter &quot;mysql -u root&quot;.  If you get the "mysql&gt; prompt, then your installation was successful.</li>
  <li>To integrate MySQL with PHP, do the following:<br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cd /var <br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mkdir mysql <br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cd mysql <br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ln -s /tmp/mysql.sock mysql.sock </li>
  <li>You should assign the root user a password: ALTER USER root IDENTIFIED BY &#39;new_password&#39; <br />
      Example:  ALTER USER &#39;root&#39;@&#39;localhost&#39; IDENTIFIED BY &#39;my_new_password&#39;</li>
</ul>

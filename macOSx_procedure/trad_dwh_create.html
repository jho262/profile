The database is for a DVD rental business.<br />
The sakila OLTP database contains the below 23 tables.<br />

A data warehouse is an online analytical process (OLAP) database.  The data warehouse is in a de-normalized form to improve query runtimes in comparison to the OLTP database which is a highly normalized database.  The data warehouse is used primarily for queries to extract data to facilitate decision making regarding the business.  The data warehouse is loaded periodically, usually nightly, using an ETL process that extracts data from an online transaction process (OLTP) database.  The data warehouse is in the form of a dimensional model with fact and dimension tables and it is primarily used for queries.  Typically, the users of a data wareshouse are a small group consisting of management, executives, and data analysts.<br />
<br />
The first step in designing a data warehouse for the sakila DVD rental database is to determine what questions the Business would like to answer.  For example, the Business may wish to know answers to the following questions.
<ul type='disc'>
  <li>Which store has the most rentals?</li>
  <li>Which district has the most rentals?</li>
  <li>Which week of the month has the highest volume of rentals?</li>
  <li>Which week of the year has the highest volume of rentals?</li>
  <li>Is the rental business growing, month over month? and year over year?</li>
  <li>What time of the day is the most active for DVD returns?</li>
  <li>Do rentals decrease when the film duration exceeds a certain time?</li>
  <li>What staff member has the most rentals? the least rentals?</li>
  <li>What movie category type (e.g. genre) results in the most rentals?  Note that this is not addressed in the sample data warehouse schema that was designed for this project.
</ul>

Once the Business needs are identified, then design of the data warehouse can proceed.  Next step is to define what will be the facts (i.e. measures) and what will be the dimensions (i.e. aspects of the business process) to be tracked. <br />
<br />
The facts for a business are typically sales, cost, inventory, and units sold.  Dimensions will typically answer the questions:  what, where, who, and when.  For a DVD rental business, the dimensions would typically be product (i.e., the what), store (i.e., the where), customer (i.e., the who), sales person (again, the who), date and time (i.e. the when).<br />
<br />
For our data warehouse, the following is defined for the fact and dimensions:<br />
<ul type='disc'>
  <li>Facts:  units rented and units returned</li>
  <li>Dimensions:  product (i.e. film), store, customer, staff, date and time</li>
</ul>
<br />
The data warehouse schema that will be utilized to answer the Business questions is shown in the figure below:

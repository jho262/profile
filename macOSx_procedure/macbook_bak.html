<h2>MACBOOK - CREATING A SYSTEM BACKUP</h2>
<fieldset>
<p>This procedure is necessary to prevent a catastrophe from happening should your MacBook OS X system get corrupted during installation of the many applications that is planned.  <br />
<br />
There are several ways that a system backup can be taken.  One way is to use Time Machine which comes installed with your MacBook.  An alternative approach is to download a third party application called SuperDuper.  The advantage of using SuperDuper is that it allows you to create 1 or more bootable USB backup(s).  This is advantageous because you can use an external USB drive as a sandbox (SSD external drive is recommended for speed).  You will bootup the Mac OS X from the USB device and then you can apply whatever application installs or updates as you wish.  If corruption occurs, your primary Mac OS X environment will still be pristine and unaffected.  Only after you have confirmed all the candidate applications and updates are ok will you then apply them onto your primary Mac OS X environment running from your internal hard drive.<br />
<br />
For my specific environment, I have the following configuration:</p>
<ul type='disc'>
  <li>Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite with 250GB internal hard disk</li>
  <li>SuperDuper 2.9.</li>
  <li>Samsung SSD 500GB external hard drive partitioned into 2.  The two partitions allow for 2 system backups to be taken.  This SSD drive is utilized specifically as a sandbox (i.e. a testing ground for new applications or updates to existing applications).</li>
  <li>Western Digital 2 TB My Passport external USB drive partitioned into 8 parts.  This is where I keep my more permanent backups.</li>
</ul>
<br />
To make a backup, launch SuperDuper from the Applications folder.  Then select the source and target locations using "Backup - all files" option.  Select the option to make it bootable.<br />
<br />
Upon restart of your Macbook, hold down the &quot;option&quot; key when you hear the startup audio.  The startup manager should be launched allowing you to select which device that you wish to launch your Mac OS X operating system.  To bootup from the USB device, click on the icon for that device and then the associated arrow.  If you are using an SSD device, then bootup will be pretty quick.  Otherwise, it will take a bit of time to load from your conventional external hard drives (e.g. the Western Digital My Passport drive).

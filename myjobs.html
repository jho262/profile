					<h2 class="lhdr">Programmer Analyst - Insight Global (Safeway contract), May 2014 - present<h4></h4></h2>
					<img class="mypic" src="images/retail_products_170x130_clear.png" alt="retail products image" />
					<h3>Safeway, Retailing</h3>
					<p>Migrated PDX Classic pharmacy reports and extracts to Enterprise Pharmacy System (EPS) and developed the web-based tools and programs to automate 
the conversion of the PDX to EPS database using Oracle SQL, Elixir javascript, perl CGI, PostgreSQL, shell scripting, and HTML</p>
				<ul>
<li class="spaceB">Using SQL Developer, wrote complex Oracle PL/SQL as part of effort to upgrade from PDX classic to new Enterprise Pharmacy System (EPS)
</li>
<li class="spaceB">Validated report conversions using shell scripting to reformat output for complete column by column comparison
</li>
<li class="spaceB">Migrated post-processing shell scripts from AIX 5.3 to Linux 2.6 and updated to reflect new EPS structure
</li>
<li class="spaceB">Utilized Subversion as central repository for maintaining Elixir data sources and rml files

</li>
<li class="spaceB">Performed post-pilot SQL debugging to root cause errors in reporting and developed fixes to accurately extract Sales data to comply with Business requirements
</li>
<li class="spaceB">Generated shell programs to automate the EPS conversion process including pre-conversion checks, extracting compressed source data backups, sending progress notifications, 
performing sanity checks, and sending final summary notification. Significant time savings, repeated accuracy in performing conversions, and the ability to convert multiple stores per night 
are the obvious benefits that would be realized many times over with the approximately 1,000 stores that would undergo conversion.
</li>
<li class="spaceB">Developed a web-based conversion dashboard using perl cgi, shell, expect, and postgreSQL scripts, HTML,  javascript, and cron jobs.
</li>
<li class="spaceB">Designed, implemented, documented, and trained offshore deployment team on the conversion automation system which allows for an accelerated conversion schedule only limited 
by the pre-conversion and post-conversion manual procedures.  Key components included web-based invocation of scripts, centralized dashboard for high level view and real time status on multiple 
stores undergoing conversion on a single night.
</li>
<li class="spaceB">Collaborated with and coordinated efforts by system administrators, support team, application development, change management, QA, and hardware management to implement 
the automated conversion system
</li>
<li class="spaceB">Streamlined the process of extracting receivable and  credit transaction data from numerous stores using expect script to remotely connect, invoke SQL, and format output 
to facilitate Accounting&apos;s efforts to reconcile discrepancies arising from the conversion.
